    <p>This site was created by 4 students from Google’s Applied Machine Learning Intensive (AMLI) program during the summer of 2019. These students are computer science, engineering, and information science majors attending schools in South Dakota, Colorado, New York and Massachusetts. 

This site was inspired by the longing to eat the same food from a hometown favorite in a different location. It was also inspired by the laziness of not wanting to read dozens of reviews to understand why a restaurant got the rating it did.

    <p> We'd like to give special thanks to our professors and TA's from Google and the Claremont Colleges for their support throughout the process (and the snacks). We'd also like to thank the rest of the AMLI students for their support, humor, and memories. </p>
